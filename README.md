# zenDzeeMods_CompanionsPatrols

## How to build sources
Open zenDzeeMods_CompanionsPatrols.csproj in the notepad and edit property `<MNB2DIR>` according to location of your game.
Now you can open zenDzeeMods_CompanionsPatrols.sln in VisualStudio and build it.

1. If a companion patrols around your settlement, this increases the relation with notables in the settlement.
2. You can order your companion to focus on patrolling. And she will give priority to patrolling over other objectives.
3. If the companion is focused on patrolling, she cannot be summoned to the army unless it is the player’s army.
4. Mod does not saves any data. Safe to install and uninstall it in the mid game.
5. Very simple mod, should be compatible with everything.
6. Works on 1.3.1 and 1.4.0. In theory, should work on 1.2.1 too.

Relation will increase by 1 (or 2, depending on your perks) every 24 hour on patrol.

The mod does not overwrite companion AI, but it slightly increases the priority of patrol. If the situation requires, they can go to defend a castle or even raid the village of the enemy faction.

Note: before uninstallation make sure that none of your companions is focused on patrolling. While they are focused, game marks them as characters who are "occupied by event". These characters cannot take other tasks, until they complete the current task.
